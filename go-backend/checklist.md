# checklist

## api implementation

- [x] POST `/users/login`

- [x] POST `/users/logout`

- [x] POST `/users/create`

- [x] GET `/users/info`

- [x] POST `/equations/create`

- [x] POST `/equations/remove/{post_id}`

- [x] POST `/equations/edit/{post_id}`

- [x] GET `/equations/one/{post_id}`

- [x] GET `/equations/search/{title}`

## functionality

- [x] good search

- [ ] proper database implementation rather than memory

- [ ] benchmarking

## refactoring

- [ ] every "step" (i.e. if-block required) should be it's own function
